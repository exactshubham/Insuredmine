### Please upload the working code to your GitHub repo and share the URL.

### Note: Make sure the repo is public and has steps to run the project.



# Prerequisite

Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your machine, if not already installed.

# Steps to run the project :-

### Step 1 :-

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

### Step 2 :-

Install the required dependencies by running the command npm install.

### Step 3 :-

Set up the necessary environment variables, such as database credentials or API keys, as specified in the project documentation.

### Step 4 :-

Start the server by running the command npm start.

The server should now be running on the specified port, and you should be able to access it via a web browser or an API client like Postman.

### Step 5 :-

To upload Excel data, send a POST request to the /upload endpoint with the Excel file attached as a form-data object with key "file".

### Step 6 :-

Use the specified API routes to interact with the server and perform CRUD operations on the user, account, and policy data. For example, to create a new user, you would send a POST request to the /users endpoint with the required data in the request body.

### Bonus Tip :-

If you encounter any issues or errors, consult the project documentation.
